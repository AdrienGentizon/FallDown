**Description:**
This is a _TETRIS_-like game. Coded in JavaScript thanks to _PixiJS_ library.
I am not aiming of coded it in the most clever way. Yet I try my best at least to code
in a clear and concise way following ES6 style (as far as I know it).

**Play the game:**
I will focus on a well polished web page later. I think I will use Jekyll since it is the tool used under GitHub pages.
Yet, you still can play around with the game [here](./src.index.html).
It is still a very work in progress project so you will encounter some issues for sure.

**Technologies inside:**

- PixiJS
- Classes
- Webpack
- Babel
- Sass
- Git and Github
- Jekyll

**Assets used:**
_(I would like to edit all of the material but for the moment I am using some from other people)_

- Fruit pixel art by _Henry Software_ just [here](https://henrysoftware.itch.io/pixel-food)
- Font by _CodeMan38_ just [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?query=start+2p)
- Background by _me_

**Remerciements:**
Many thanks to _Grafikart_, he is a precious guy to learn front-end and back-end development related stuffs. Make sure to pay a visit to his [site](https://www.grafikart.fr/). His YouTube channel is a [goldmine](https://www.youtube.com/user/grafikarttv) too.

**One last for the road:**
Some day I hope to create the _infamous_ **Le Bureau des tentatives** to host this kind of humble project.
Enjoy & Merci.
